### Daignose_That
Disease prediction systems allow medical practitioners to intervene early and prevent chronic  illness by identifying people who are at risk. Our web app aims to predict whether the user has a certain disease or not. The prediction  has been done on the basis of general questions asked in the form of multiple-choice  questions.  Alzheimer and Tuberculosis models are also based on the X-ray and scan images provided by  the users. 
### Scope
The user can choose among 6 diseases and on choosing a certain disease general information 
about that disease and informative facts are provided to the user. 
The 6 diseases which we have included in our website are:
1. Lung Cancer 
2. Heart diseases
3. Diabetes 
4. Urinary Inflammation 
5. Alzheimer’s 
6. Tuberculosis (TB)

### Architecture Design
• Initially on the introduction page the user has to give a short questionnaire where some basic 
questions age and gender are asked and it’s users option to give the details.
• The user can select any of the disease for which either the user will have to upload his/her xray scan or will have to give a questionnaire. There will be total 6 diseases out of which 
Alzheimer, tuberculosis will take image as input from the user and diabetes, lung cancer, heart 
disease, urinary disease will be a questionnaire for the user. 
• And after the prediction is made a recommendation will be made and solution and remedies 
will be displayed for the user.

### Hardware and software requirements
Procurement of hardware for using the system is OUT OF SCOPE of this project and only software has been used and implemented.

### Working flow of the website
• The user interacts with our landing page containing an optional questionnaire. If the user skips this questionnaire they are asked to choose 1 of 6 diseases for which they want to get tested.

• After filling the basic details user is redirected to choose one of the 6 diseases and get 
himself/herself tested.
• Here the user can choose one of the diseases to get tested.

• After the user chooses which diseases they want to get tested for, they need to answer certain 
medical questions or upload relevant medical imaging information. 
For example, the webpage of Urinary disease is shown below
