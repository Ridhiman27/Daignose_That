Disease prediction systems allow medical practitioners to intervene early and prevent chronic  illness by identifying people who are at risk. Our web app aims to predict whether the user has a certain disease or not. The prediction  has been done on the basis of general questions asked in the form of multiple-choice  questions.  Alzheimer and Tuberculosis models are also based on the X-ray and scan images provided by  the users.
