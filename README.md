### Daignose_That
Disease prediction systems allow medical practitioners to intervene early and prevent chronic  illness by identifying people who are at risk. Our web app aims to predict whether the user has a certain disease or not. The prediction  has been done on the basis of general questions asked in the form of multiple-choice  questions.  Alzheimer and Tuberculosis models are also based on the X-ray and scan images provided by  the users.
